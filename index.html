        <h2>About</h2>
        <p> 
            I am a CNRS research scientist at IRIF, Université Paris Cité. I received my PhD from École Normale Supérieure de Paris (ENS) in November 2017, under the supervision of David Pointcheval and Hoeteck Wee. In 2017 – 2019, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), in the team of Dennis Hofheinz.

        <p>
            My main research interests are secure multiparty computation and zero-knowledge proofs (both foundational and practical aspects), as well as the theoretical foundations of cryptography.
