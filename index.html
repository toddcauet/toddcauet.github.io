      ## Geoffroy Couteau
      **CNRS research scientist at IRIF**
  
      ### About
  
      I am a CNRS research scientist at IRIF, Université Paris Cité. I received my PhD from École Normale Supérieure de Paris (ENS) in November 2017, under the supervision of David Pointcheval and Hoeteck Wee. In 2017 – 2019, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), in the team of Dennis Hofheinz.
  
      My main research interests are secure multiparty computation and zero-knowledge proofs (both foundational and practical aspects), as well as the theoretical foundations of cryptography.
  
      For an up-to-date list of my publications, you can check my publication page, my dblp profile, or my Google scholar profile. All my publications become available at some point in open access format on the ePrint archive.
  
      ### News
  
      **June 2024:** The Algorithms & Complexity team at IRIF (CNRS, Université Paris-Cité) in Paris, France is inviting applications for several fully-funded postdoctoral positions (1-2 years) to work on cryptography.
